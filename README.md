## General info

The purpose of this first project is construct meaning of my learning of different languages through a viable web application. The application begins working upon loading displaying a random quote, from an API hosted by FavQs. Each quote has keywords associated with it, which I utilize to run through another API hosted by Unsplash. This enables the application to target images with a similar tag. The application also allows for the user to search for a quote based on a keyword.
